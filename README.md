## Utilities

* [TCLab](https://github.com/jckantor/TCLab). Python module for accessing the
[Temperature Control Laboratory](http://apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/ArduinoTemperatureControl), an
 Arduino based device for hands-on learning of process control.
* [TCLab-sketch](https://github.com/jckantor/TCLab-sketch). An Arduino sketch for download and installation
on the [Temperature Control Laboratory](http://apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/ArduinoTemperatureControl).
that implements a simple communications protocol.
* [nbpages](https://github.com/jckantor/nbpages). A command line tool to maintain a repository of Jupyter 
notebooks.
